Charlotte: He is soooo unfair
Charlotte: *pouts*
Player: Who?
Charlotte: My dumb stupid butler!
Charlotte: He is so super mean, he won’t buy me all the candy!
Player: Oh, well I’m sure he’s just watching out for you.
Charlotte: Nuh-uh! He’s just dumb and does whatever my parents want!
Charlotte: I hate him! I hate him! I hate him! *huffs*
Charlotte: Can I please have some more candy, stranger?
Player: Oh no no no, I’m not touching that situation.
Charlotte: I know the stupid man can pay for it!
Charlotte: He keeps all our family money all locked up and secret like!
Charlotte: I’ve seen it! I know where it is! You could have some too you know…
Player: Kid. Calm down, no one here is getting candy.
Charlotte: *Cries Aggressively*
Charlotte: How dare you! Bubble Freak! Go away!

Charlotte: My Mommy makes all this money from the stupid farmland and stupid Mr. Worcestershire and I don’t get what I want! 
Charlotte: This isn’t fair! You’re mean.

Charlotte: *puffs cheeks*
