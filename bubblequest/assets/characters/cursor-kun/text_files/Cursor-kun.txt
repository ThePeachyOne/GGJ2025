Cursor-kun: Ugh I don't have anyone to go to the pixel dance with…
Cursor-kun: And it’s tomorrow!
Cursor-kun: Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Player: Are you okay?
Cursor-kun: I’m totally fine…
Cursor-kun: Why would someone with rock-hard abs like mine have problems?
Player: Everyone has problems…
Cursor-kun: …
Cursor-kun: Oh fine you’re right!
Cursor-kun: I can’t decide if I should take Bristle-chan to the pixel dance or not.
Player: Why?
Cursor-kun: I said something “mean” to her a while ago I guess *whisper* it was totally true…
Cursor-kun: But it means I have to apologize to her if I want to take her to the dance!
<SPLIT>
Cursor-kun: Ugh fine, only because she’s totally hot now…
<CHOICE>
Cursor-kun: You’re right! I’ll just ask Bucketina-chan instead.
